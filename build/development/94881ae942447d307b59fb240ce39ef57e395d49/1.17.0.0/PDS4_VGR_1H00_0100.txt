	v0.1.0.0  2022-06-10
	  Created by unifying the vg1 and vg2 namespace dictionaries, which
	will be deprecated.  Specifically, the new base class Voyager contains
	the legacy label (optional), a class describing telemetry (also
	optional), a class describing timing (required), and a required class
	describing instrument-specific parameters (currently, only ISS is
	implemented).  
	  This is a preliminary non-release version.  Changes have not been
	tracked during initial drafting, but will be henceforth.

   description            The now-obsolete "VICAR-1" label that was originally attached to the image. To the extent possible, the information is captured in normal VICAR-2 and PDS4 labels. The labels are being retained for historical documentation purposes, and in case there is any question about how the rest of the label items were derived. Contemporaneous Voyager documentation sometimes refers to these legacy labels.

   description            Time at which the image was acquired. The image_time element is duplicated from the source product label. It provides the time of shutter close calculated from spacecraft clock using both the coarse (seconds) and fine (subRTI) counters (UTC). (A subRTI is approximately 4 msec (1/256 second)). The value is identical to that given in start_time_doy, and start_date_time. Although it is redundant, it is retained here for historical reasons. When the shutter was inhibited (ie SHUTTER_STATE_ID=”DISABLED”), the IMAGE_TIME = START_TIME = STOP_TIME, and all three represent the start of the exposure window during the prepare cycle of the image.
