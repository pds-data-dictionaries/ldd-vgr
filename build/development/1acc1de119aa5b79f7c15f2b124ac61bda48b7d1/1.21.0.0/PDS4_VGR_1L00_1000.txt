	    v0.1.0.0  2022-06-10
	    Created by unifying the vg1 and vg2 namespace dictionaries, which will be deprecated.  Specifically, the new base class Voyager contains the legacy label (optional), a class describing telemetry (also optional), a class describing timing (required), and a required class describing instrument-specific parameters (currently, only ISS is implemented).  
	    This is a preliminary non-release version.  Changes have not been tracked during initial drafting, but will be henceforth. 
	
	    v0.2.0.0  2022-08-23
	    Continuing to develop content, in advance of any use of this LDD.
	    Updated enumerated values for compression_state, edit_mode_id
	    Deleted beam, companding, elec_cal, exposure_type, filter_position, filter_step, flood, g1_voltage_count, geometry_state, image_time, image_type, pixel_dn_average_thresh, pixel_dn_average_status, shutter_exposure, shutter_reset, shutter_open, shutter_close, start_time_doy, start_time_ymd, stop_time_doy, stop_time_ymd, telemetry_mode
	    Deleted classes Image_Description, Image_State, and Instrument_State.  The attributes that were in Image_Description and Image_State are now in the previous parent class ISS, while the attributes that were in Instrument_State have all been deleted per the line above.
	    Renamed data_anomaly_type to pds_source_product_data_anomaly_type
	    Made some attributes nillable or optional
	
	    v0.3.0.0  2022-09-20
	    Continuing to develop content, in advance of any use of this LDD.
	    Restored many of the attributes removed in v0.2, while prepending "legacy_label_" to the attribute names and adding class ISS_Legacy_Label to contain them. 
	    Also moved some attributes from class ISS to class ISS_Legacy_Label, again now prepending those attribute names with "legacy_label_". 

	    v0.3.1.0  2023-03-09
	    Added enumerated value "Manual" to legacy_label_na_exposure_type and legacy_label_wa_exposure_type.
